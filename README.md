# Stoic CarItems
- ox_inventory Standalone support | âœ… 
- qb-core support | hypothetical 
- esx support | hypothetical 

## Features
- Define a usable item that spawns a vehicle when used.
- Automatically handles vehicle ownership for ESX and QBCore frameworks.
- Uses built-in progress bar and animations for item usage.
- Provides notifications for successful or failed actions.

## How It Works
1. **Define the Item**: The item is defined in `items.lua` with properties such as label, weight, stack, close, and client-side usage settings.
2. **Item Usage**: When the item is used, it triggers a client-side export function that spawns a vehicle with the same name as the item.
3. **Vehicle Spawning**: The client script requests and spawns the vehicle model, then places the player inside the vehicle.
4. **Server-Side Ownership**: A server-side event assigns vehicle ownership to the player using either ESX or QBCore framework, or handles it without a framework if neither is found.

1. **Add the Item to Your Inventory**: Ensure the item is added to your player's inventory.
2. **Use the Item**: When used, the item will spawn a vehicle with the same name as the item and assign ownership to the player.
